To write a shell script that executes the command `alter system set wallet_root='/u01/app/oracle/admin/oratsc01/wallet' scope=spfile sid='*';`, you can create a simple script using any text editor. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a new file**: Use a text editor like `nano`, `vi`, or `gedit` to create a new file. Let's name it `set_wallet.sh`.

   ```bash
   nano set_wallet.sh
   ```

2. **Write the script**: In the editor, write the following script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Script to set Oracle wallet root
   
   # Variables
   WALLET_ROOT="/u01/app/oracle/admin/oratsc01/wallet"
   SID="*"
   
   # SQL command
   SQL_COMMAND="alter system set wallet_root='$WALLET_ROOT' scope=spfile sid='$SID';"
   
   # Execute SQL command as sysdba using SQL*Plus
   sqlplus / as sysdba <<EOF
   $SQL_COMMAND
   exit;
   EOF
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `#!/bin/bash`: This line specifies that the script should be interpreted using Bash.
   - `WALLET_ROOT` and `SID` are variables holding the values for `wallet_root` and `sid` in your SQL command.
   - `SQL_COMMAND` constructs the SQL command string.
   - `sqlplus / as sysdba <<EOF`: This starts a here document to send commands to `sqlplus` as the `sysdba` user.
   - `$SQL_COMMAND`: This inserts the SQL command into the here document.
   - `exit;`: Ends the `sqlplus` session.
   - `EOF`: Indicates the end of the here document.

3. **Save and exit**: Save the file (`Ctrl + O` in nano, `:wq` in vi) and exit the text editor.

4. **Make the script executable**: Before running the script, make sure it is executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x set_wallet.sh
   ```

5. **Run the script**: Execute the script to set the Oracle wallet root.

   ```bash
   ./set_wallet.sh
   ```

   This will execute the SQL command using `sqlplus` as the `sysdba`, setting the wallet root as specified.

Remember to adjust the `WALLET_ROOT` variable in the script to match the actual path where your Oracle wallet resides, and ensure that `sqlplus` is accessible and configured correctly on your system for the `sysdba` user. Adjust permissions and security as necessary for your environment.
