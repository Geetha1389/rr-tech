Give sudo previliges to users


add sudo group to user 

usermod -aG sudo username 

Checking group membership

groups username

here we create the password for sudo user---

sudo passwd username


enter new password
reenter new password

edit the /etc/sudoers file

vi /etc/sudoers

enter the user name like root in this file username ALL=(ALL)    ALL

will login as sudo username 

here sudo whoami command

it asked passwd then enter passwd 
 --the result must and should come root
then user have sudo previliges

if we want without asking password we give --username ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL
we entered this then it doesn't ask password
